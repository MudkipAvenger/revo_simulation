# IGVC_Simulation
Chicago EDT's simulated course for the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition. The simulation includes a very similar ground texture (real grass image texture), with white lines taken straight from the IGVC rules's sample advanced course. An uneven ground was also created in 3DS Max, in order to create a bumpy terrain.
